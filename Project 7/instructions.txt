• Complete the code of the four functions in Ledbetter-Project7.c
– mergeSort(ArrList *list)
– ms(ArrList *list, int start, int end, int *aux)
– quickSort(ArrList *list)
– qs(ArrList *list, int start, int end)

• Ensure your mergesort implementation uses as little auxiliary space as possible.
• Ensure your quicksort implementation is in place, that is, no auxillary space is
used.
• Note that the test code in main() basically generates a random list. That same
list is sorted with 4 methods: selection, bubble, merge, and quick sort. Selection
sort and bubble sort are already implented and display the number of comparisons
they used, respectively.
• Ensure that your code also displays how many data comparisons that mergesort
and quicksort take.

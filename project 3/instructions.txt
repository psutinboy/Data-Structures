Using LinkStack.c as a model, implement a linked queue two different ways (sub-
mit two .c code files)
• The first way, implement a linked queue without a dummy node.
• The second way, implement a linked queue using a dummy node.
• In both situations make sure the linked queue can store data of any type by using
void pointers.

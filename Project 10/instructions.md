# MATH 626 Project 10 - Breadth First Search

The purpose of this project is to use breadth first search to analyze components of a graph.

## Tasks

Complete the code of the functions in BFS.c:

- `loadGraph()`
- `destroyGraph(Graph *graph)`
- `bfs(Graph *graph, int startVertex, int componentNum)`
